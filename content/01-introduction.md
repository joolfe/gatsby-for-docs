# Introduction

Welcome to the "gatsby-docs" tutorial, before start just let me explain the motivation to create this tutorial...

I was thinking in test gatsby to see if i can use in my daily work so i do what i usually do, read the docs, and while reading i see that this could be a great tool fro static documentations, i mean a sustitutor of gitbook or vuepress... so i decide to work on a little POC to create static doc using gatsby and then i reallize that to avoid read all the doc again (nothing against the doc i think are great) i can writte a little tutorial about my progress so in the future i can resort to this when i need.

And after this i thought, why i don't publish the tutorial? maybe is usefull for others... and here is where you are, all what you are seeing in this moment is the result of this tutorial, i mean this page 😊.

# Discharge of responsibility

You maybe see that this tutorial is a bit 'informal' 👻, the used language, the expresions, the explanations, errors in the code... 

The first thing that you should know is that im not a native english speaker and i know my english is far from perfect so i will do my best 😉, aslo i'm not a writer, normally i write docs for myself so i do at my style, and finally while I'm describing my steps you probabily can found that i get errors in code and are inside the tutorial also, i usually always do that because errors are as important as sucess 😇.

Indeed is going to be a very small tutorial but just enought to explain what we need, so lets started 🏁.
